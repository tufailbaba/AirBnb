# AirBnb
🏡 Airbnb Clone (Ruby on Rails)

This project is a full-stack Airbnb-inspired web application developed using Ruby on Rails as part of a practical learning journey into Rails development. The application is designed to help understand how real-world web platforms are structured while gaining hands-on experience with Rails conventions, MVC architecture, and database-driven applications.

The project focuses on building a scalable and maintainable codebase by implementing core Rails concepts such as models, controllers, views, routing, and ActiveRecord. PostgreSQL is used as the primary database, and the frontend is built with standard web technologies to create a clean and responsive user interface.
